Components needed:
Board (stateful)
Square (stateless)
Canvas (stateless)
PlayAgain (stateless)

Information stored in state:
which symbols are on the board (state.board)
what coordinates to draw the line (this.canvasCoordinates)
whose turn it is (this. curPlayer)
is the game over (this.gameOver)

Functions needed:

handleClick:  should change state to put an x or an o in the clicked square.
Should not do anything if the game is over or if the square is not empty.
Should check for win after updating the board.
If the game is won, this should update state to reflect that the game is over
and a new line is drawn.

checkForWin
should check if either player has three in a row.  Will use an array of arrays
with the sets of winning indecies.  If the squares at any set of indicies are
all the same value should return true, otherwise should return false.
This should also return the coordinates for the line that is drawn through
the winning symbols.

RenderSquares
should make a square
should make squares on top have no top border, left no left border, etc.
should put the correct symbol in the newBoard

endOfGame
should render only if the game is over
should render a different message for a tie and a win
should render a play again button

handlePlayAgainClick
should reset the state to the original state so the game is restarted

Stateless components:

Square
a td that runs handleClick on a click
properties: value, onClick, className

Canvas
a canvas element that draws a line
properties: coordinates

PlayAgain
a button that runs handlePlayAgainClick on click
properties: onClick
