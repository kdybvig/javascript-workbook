I want to fulfill the following user stories:

1. I can add items to the list
2. I can delete items from the list
3. I can drag the list items to reorder them
4. I can check and uncheck the list items
5. I can press a button to clear all the items in the list
6. I can press a button to uncheck all of the items in the list

Components:
App - could make the app a container component, but instead I am including the
buttons for adding, clearing, input, and unchecking.  I may consider refactoring
the code in the future as I learn more about the best practices and styles for
React.

List: Contains everything having to do with the list and not involving buttons
outside of the list, including all of the logic for reordering the list,
deleting items from the list, and checking or unchecking items from the list,
but not adding new items to the list, or unchecking all the items on the list.

Task: This will be where the information about each individual task is displayed.
The task will include an input for the checkbox, some text, and a delete button.
The task will be both the drag source and drag target for the react-dnd.

Functions needed:

Handle clicks for all the buttons
dragstart and hover functions for the tasks
handlekeydown for the input to make it add on enter
reorder list function to reorder items on the list when isDragging

Dependencies:
React-dnd to handle drag and drop
Lodash - need flow to add both drag and drop to same component, and using
uniqueId to give each task component a unique key and id


Using react-dnd sortable-simple (on github: https://tinyurl.com/y8lbx2ub) as a
reference for how to create a sortable list.
